# Simulation and Design Optimisation Model for Agrivoltaics üå±‚òÄÔ∏è

This project develops a **digital twin of an agrivoltaic scenario**, simulating both **solar energy generation** and **agricultural crop yields** under shared land use. The model serves as a **simulation and design optimisation tool**, enabling exploration of design parameters to improve both photovoltaic (PV) and crop performance.  

The overarching goal is to demonstrate how agrivoltaic systems can be optimised to maximise land productivity, providing a balance between **renewable energy production** and **sustainable agriculture**.

## üîß Model Setup

The model recreates a modular agrivoltaic design in MATLAB, defining a range of design parameters such as:

- **Module geometry**: panel size, tilt, and tracking configuration  
- **Array structure**: row spacing, ground coverage ratio (GCR), height  
- **Environmental inputs**: solar irradiance, weather data, soil properties  
- **Crop parameters**: light use efficiency, phenology, water balance  

The system is built as a **modular framework**, allowing independent validation and analysis of its core components:  

- **Solar energy modelling**  
- **Shading and irradiance reduction**  
- **Microclimate representation**  
- **Crop growth modelling**

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Modelling

The solar model incorporates **tracking algorithms** and computes **direct and diffuse irradiance** incident on both the panels and the ground beneath the structure.  

- **Shading Factor**: quantifies the reduction in irradiance at the ground caused by the array.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: demonstrates the relationship between GCR and shading, validating against reported values in literature.

## üå°Ô∏è Microclimate Modelling

The microclimate model captures the effects of shading on **temperature, humidity, and soil water balance** beneath the array.  

- **Evapotranspiration**: calculated dynamically to determine plant water use.  
- **Water Stress**: integrated into the crop growth model via rainfed vs irrigated scenarios.  

This allows analysis of how **reduced solar input** interacts with **water availability**, directly influencing crop performance.

## üåæ Crop Growth Modelling

The crop model uses crop-specific physiological inputs (e.g. **tomato** and **wheat**) to simulate yield under agrivoltaic conditions.  

- **Inputs**: sourced from experimental studies and growth guides.  
- **Outputs**: yield reduction under shade, validated against reported crop trials.  
- **Scenarios**: open-field baseline, agrivoltaic with shading, and irrigated vs rainfed systems.

## üìä Key Findings

- **Shading Validation**:  
  Average reductions of ~30% in irradiance reported in literature align with model outputs (36‚Äì59% depending on GCR).  

- **Crop Validation**:  
  - Tomatoes (Spain): 28% reduction under agrivoltaics.  
  - Wheat (UK): 33% reduction under agrivoltaics.  
  - Irrigation boosts yields by 57% (Spain) and 24% (UK).  

- **Design Insight**:  
  Tomatoes show slightly greater tolerance to shading than wheat, suggesting crop choice significantly influences system optimisation.

## üìà Optimisation Perspective

By coupling **solar yield** and **crop growth** in one framework, the tool can be used to:  

- Explore the trade-off between energy and food production.  
- Optimise design parameters such as **row spacing, height, and tracking**.  
- Support **site-specific agrivoltaic deployment strategies**.
